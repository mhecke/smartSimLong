\item{out}{output directory}

\item{longBam}{a single bam file, or a directory containing several long read bam files, used to characterize long read data (when available)}

\item{nCPU}{number of parallel CPU processes [default = 4]}

\item{numReads}{max number of reads in short bam file to be used for data characterization, by default all reads are used}

\item{nBam}{number of short bam files used for data characterization, only used if multiple bam files are used, by default all bam files are used}

\item{seed}{random seed for reproducibility [default = 1234]}
